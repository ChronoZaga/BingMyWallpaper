# BingMyWallpaper

Run the EXE and it will download the Bing Wallpaper of the day in 4K resolution to your temp directory, and set it as you Windows wallpaper.

Run the EXE with an argument of a number of days prior ("C:\users\yourname\desktop\BingMyWallpaper.exe 1"), and it will use the Bing wallpaper from that many days back.
